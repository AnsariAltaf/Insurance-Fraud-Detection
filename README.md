# Insurance-Fraud-Detection
Problem Statement :-
Based on the data given by the client, a Motor Insurance provider, we have to identify whether a claim submitted by the customer is fraudulent or not.
Although motor insurance is for accidents only, but people try to claim other repairs also by creating false claims ,false witnesses and false proofs.
In order to curb this issue, the insurance company has asked to make an application that can identify such fraud claims.
If our model predicts that a claim is fraud then this claim will be passed through additional manual checks.
